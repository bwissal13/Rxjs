# RxJS and Signals Demo

A comprehensive demonstration application showcasing RxJS Observables and Angular Signals, built with Angular 17. This project serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for reactive programming patterns in Angular.

## 🎯 Purpose

This demo application aims to:
- Demonstrate the power and flexibility of RxJS Observables
- Showcase Angular's new Signals API and its benefits
- Compare different reactive programming approaches
- Provide practical, real-world examples
- Help developers understand when to use each approach

## 🚀 Features

- Deep dive into Angular Signals with practical examples
- RxJS Observable patterns and best practices
- Comparison between Observables and Subjects
- Interactive code examples with live editing
- Real-world use cases including:
  - Stock portfolio tracking with live updates
  - Form handling with reactive patterns
  - State management demonstrations
  - Performance optimization examples
- Observer pattern implementation
- Beautiful, responsive UI with animations
